# Real-time Mel Spectrogram Visualization on ESP32 with APA102 LEDs

This project utilizes the ESP32 microcontroller with the ESP-IDF framework to create a real-time Mel Spectrogram visualization of audio data captured from a MEMS microphone. The visualization is displayed on Addressable LEDs (APA102).

## Features
- Real-time audio data processing: The ESP32 captures audio data from the MEMS microphone using PDM (Pulse Density Modulation) and processes it in real-time to generate the Mel Spectrogram.
- Mel Spectrogram visualization: The processed audio data is represented as a Mel Spectrogram, providing insights into the frequency content of the audio signal.
- APA102 LED integration: The Mel Spectrogram is displayed in real-time on Addressable LEDs (APA102), creating an interactive visual representation of the audio data.
